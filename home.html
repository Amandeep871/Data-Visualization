        <h2>Description</h2>
        
         <p>Unemployment generally falls during periods of economic prosperity and rises during recessions, creating significant pressure on public finances as tax revenue falls and social safety net costs increase. Government spending and taxation decisions (fiscal policy) and U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate adjustments (monetary policy) are important tools for managing the unemployment rate. There may be an economic trade-off between unemployment and inflation, as policies designed to reduce unemployment can create inflationary pressure, and vice versa. The U.S. Federal Reserve (the Fed) has a dual mandate to achieve full employment while maintaining a low rate of inflation. The major political parties debate appropriate solutions for improving the job creation rate, with liberals arguing for more government spending and conservatives arguing for lower taxes and less regulation. Polls indicate that Americans believe job creation is the most important government priority, with not sending jobs overseas the primary solution.<br>
            <h2>Unemployment can have many sources, such as the following:</h2>
		  
<p>1. New technologies and inventions</p>
<p>2. The status of the economy, which can be influenced by a recession</p>
<p>3. Competition caused by globalization and international trade</p>
<p>4. Policies of the government</p>
<p>5. Regulation and market</p>
